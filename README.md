# MordhauDupe
**THIS IS FOR HORDE**

Must Install AutoHotKey for this macro to work,

**MordhauDupeLoop is under testing, it's the same macro as the other but removes the need for step 2&3.**

**MordhauDupeLoop has a sleep time already inputed to accomedate my reconnect time this will most lickly have to be altered to match your connection time**

when AutoHotKey is installed just douple click the file to run it

You are welcome to upgrade the Macro but do not distribute the Macro

If to many people start using this macro the devs will patch it out

Have fun!
