# MordhauDupe
**THIS IS FOR HORDE**

Must Install AutoHotKey for this macro to work,

**MordhauDupeLoop is the advanced script for this automating alot of the process**

**MordhauDupeLoop is really automated and I spent to much time on it, in doing so you dont have to do alot of step HOWEVER, reconnection will have to be timed and I have built it into the script, Numpad9 is vanilla keybind for timer when you let go of Numpad9 you will get a popup giving you your reconnection time, close out of it. This does stop the duping process for that respawn.**

**All controls can be changed and are marked down in the scripts simply right click on them and click on edit**

when AutoHotKey is installed just douple click the file to run it
